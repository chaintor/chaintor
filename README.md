Tutorial to run a tor relay on a masternode vps.

![1280x600](https://github.com/chaintor/chaintor/blob/master/chaintor.png "1280x600")

As a community we like to support the Tor Project by running a view Tor relays. The tor network provides anonymity to all kind of protocols. A chaincoin masternode does not use a lot of resources on a vps. So that could be used to run a Tor relay.

## Installing a Tor relay

Debian:

```bash 
sudo apt-get install tor
```

CentOS:

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install tor
```
